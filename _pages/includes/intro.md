I work at [Department of Molecular plant biology, NIBIO](https://www.nibio.no/en) <img src='./images/NIBIO_400x400.jpg' style='width: 2em;'> as a PhD fellow now, studying the epigenetics of Woodland strawberry (_Fragaria vesca_). 

I graduated from [College of Life Science and Technology](http://lst.hzau.edu.cn/English/HOME.htm), Huazhong Agricultural University (华中农业大学生命科学与技术学院) with a bachelor's degree and from the Northeast Institute of Geography and Agriecology, Chinese academy of sciences (中国科学院东北地理与农业生态研究所) with a master's degree. We also collaborate with [Timo Hytönen](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/timo-hyt%C3%B6nen) closely in the Starberry project. 

My research interest includes epigenetics, epigenomes and how is the role of epigenome in the speices adatation and evolution.
